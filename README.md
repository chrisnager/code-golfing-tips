Tips to help lower your code golfing scores

```js
x+''  // Convert to a string
+x    // Convert to a number
~~x   // Round down to the nearest integer
-~x   // Round up to the nearest integer
!x    // Logical not operator
!!x   // Convert to a boolean
x++   // Returns x, then increments it
++x   // Increments x, then returns it
x--   // Returns x, then decrements it
--x   // Decrements x, then returns it
x+=n  // `x = x + n`
x-=n  // `x = x - n`
x*=n  // `x = x * n`
x/=n  // `x = x / n`
a?b:c // Ternary operator `if(a){b}else{c}`
```
